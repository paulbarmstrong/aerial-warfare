## Description

"Capture the Island: Airborne" is a game-mode for Arma 3 I've been creating for a few months now. The premise of the game-mode is that all players are pilots of helicopters and airplanes. Players must communicate and play as a team in order to complete objectives.

The arma engine's SQF language is very old and quirky, so that is why some of the code might look inefficient or unnecessary (For example, the SQF language does not feature implicit short circuit evaluation).

## Why

Arma 3 is one of my favorite games and flying aircraft is one of my favorite parts of the game, but I feel like there aren't any solid aircraft-centric game-modes.

A recent update to Arma 3 prompted the devs to refine the aircraft systems and add significantly more aircraft-centric API. The update is what brought my CTI airborne project into the realm of possibility.

By now I have a good understanding of the SQF language and what is and isn't possible with the current arma 3 API. I think that with the game in its current state, I shouldn't run into any more major barriers while finishing this project.
